# dynamic-form
A dynamic form you can add and remove elements from.

Made by [Landon Snodgrass](http://landonsnodgrass.com). That's me!

Check out the live version [here](http://dynamicform.landonsnodgrass.com/dynamic-form/index.html)!


Check out [Chosen.js](https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) (the badass plugin that makes selects more cooler that I used in this project!)
